# CryptoBalance
 Deployed in a cloud service like heroku, this code has the capability to launch a telegram bot who polls your account balance in all cryptocurrencies in Coinbase and transforms all of them into euros using the real time API that Binance offers. Finally the bot sends the user who initialized him the balance periodically as message form.

## Example
